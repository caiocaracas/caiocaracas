### Engineering the intersection of Hardware, Software, and AI.

I focus on **embedded systems** and **hardware acceleration**. Currently exploring how specialized architectures can enable efficient edge AI at the **Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)**, Brazil.

My work creates bridges: translating high-level algorithms into optimized silicon logic. Developing approximate incremental training for intelligent systems on **Xilinx boards** at the **Intelligent Systems Lab (LSI)**.
